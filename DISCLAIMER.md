- Comply with all **rules of engagement** and applicable laws
- Maintain **confidentiality** of any findings
- **Document everything**: Keep logs of all testing activities for reporting and compliance
- Adhere to any **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)** when handling sensitive information

### Cloud and Third-Party Services

If the target system is hosted in a **cloud environment** (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.):

- Verify that your testing is **within the cloud provider's acceptable use policy**
- Some providers require **advance notification** or have specific pentesting policies
- If you are unsure whether usage is lawful, **do not test until you have confirmed**

### Privacy and Data Protection

You must:

- Respect **data confidentiality** and **privacy laws** (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Never exfiltrate, store, or share personal data discovered during testing
- Report any accidentally discovered personal data to the system owner immediately

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities:

- **Disclose responsibly** to vendors, system owners, or appropriate authorities
- Follow **coordinated disclosure** timelines (typically 90 days)
- Never publicly disclose vulnerabilities before the owner has had time to remediate
- Never use discovered vulnerabilities for personal gain or malicious purposes

### Recommended Testing Environments

For learning and practice, use **authorized sandbox environments** such as:

- Your own isolated lab network or virtual machines
- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
- [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)
- [DVWA](https://dvwa.co.uk/) (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- The included `guinea_pigs/` test environments in this repository

**Never practice on production systems or networks you do not own.**

### Indemnification

You agree to **indemnify, defend, and hold harmless** the authors, contributors, and any affiliated parties from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from:

### Prohibited Uses

This software shall **NOT** be used for:

- Unauthorized access to any computer system or network
- Any activity that violates applicable laws or regulations
- Attacking systems without explicit written authorization
- Any malicious, harmful, or illegal purpose
- Circumventing security measures on systems you do not own
- Any activity that could cause harm to individuals or organizations

### Educational Context

This project is released in the spirit of:

- **Security research advancement**
- **Educational knowledge sharing**
- **Improving defensive security capabilities**
- **Understanding attacker methodologies to build better defenses**

The techniques demonstrated are already publicly known and documented. This tool simply automates existing security testing methodologies that are freely available in tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and Nuclei.

### Dual-Use Technology Notice

This software is a "dual-use" technology similar to:
- Kitchen knives (can cook or harm)
- Lockpicking tools (used by locksmiths and security researchers)
- Network scanners (used by IT administrators daily)

The authors release this tool for **defensive and educational purposes**. Like Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, and other industry-standard tools, this software is intended for legitimate security professionals.

### Acceptance of Terms

**By downloading, installing, or using this software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this disclaimer and all applicable terms.**
